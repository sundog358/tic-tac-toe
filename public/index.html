* File Name: index.js
*
* Description:
* This file serves as the entry point for the React Tic-Tac-Toe
* application. It initializes the application by rendering the main `App`
* component into the root DOM node. It uses React's `StrictMode` to highlight
* potential problems and enforce best practices.
*
* Purpose:
* - To bootstrap the React application and render it into the browser.
* - To set up the application structure and link core styles.
* - To facilitate integration of the React component tree with the HTML DOM.
* - To ensure adherence to React's strict coding standards via `StrictMode`.
*
* Usage:
* - This file is automatically invoked by the React build process.
* - The `App` component imported here represents the main application.
* - Modify `App` for application logic and content; `index.js` remains minimal.
* - To run the app, execute `npm start` or the equivalent start command.
*
* Key Points, Ideas, and Concepts:
* - **Entry Point**: `index.js` is the starting point for the React application.
* - **StrictMode**: A development tool that ensures adherence to React best practices.
* - **Component Rendering**: Uses `createRoot` to render the React component tree.
* - **Styling**: Links the global stylesheet `styles.css` to the application.
* - **HTML DOM Integration**: Anchors the React component tree to the DOM via the `root` element.
* - **Modular Design**: Delegates core functionality to the `App` component.
*
* Key Technical Code Components:
* 1. **React Imports**:
*    - `StrictMode`: A wrapper component for identifying potential issues.
*    - `createRoot`: The modern API for rendering the React tree into the DOM.
*
* 2. **Global Styles**:
*    - `./styles.css`: Provides styling for the entire application.
*
* 3. **App Component**:
*    - Imported from `./App`.
*    - Serves as the root of the React component hierarchy.
*
* 4. **DOM Integration**:
*    - Uses `document.getElementById("root")` to locate the root HTML element.
*    - Renders the React tree inside the DOM's `root` element.
*
* Implementation Details:
* - **React.StrictMode**:
*   - Ensures the app adheres to React best practices and highlights potential issues.
*   - Affects only development builds, not production builds.
*
* - **createRoot**:
*   - Initializes the root React tree in the `root` DOM element.
*   - Replaces the legacy `ReactDOM.render()` API.
*
* - **Component Rendering**:
*   - The `App` component is wrapped in `StrictMode` for enhanced debugging.
*   - The `App` component serves as the entry point for further development.
*
* Notes:
* - Ensure the `root` element exists in the HTML file (usually in `public/index.html`).
* - Always maintain minimal logic in `index.js` for clarity and separation of concerns.
* - The file serves as a "glue" between the React app and the HTML DOM.
*
* Dev Team Tips:
* - Use `StrictMode` to catch React lifecycle issues during development.
* - Centralize global styles in `styles.css` for consistency across the app.
* - Avoid adding non-essential logic to `index.js`â€”focus on app initialization.
